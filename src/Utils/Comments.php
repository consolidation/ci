/**

 * This is a workaround for the fact that the Symfony Yaml parser
 * does not record comments.
 *
 * Comments at the beginning and end of the file are guarenteed to
 * be retained at the beginning and the end of the resulting file.
 *
 * Comments that appear before sections of yaml that is deleted will
 * be deliberately discarded as well.
 *
 * If the resulting yaml file contents are reordered, comments may
 * become mis-ordered (attached to the wrong element).
 *
 * Comments that appear before sections of yaml that are edited may
 * be inadvertantly lost. It is recommended to always place comments
 * immediately before identifier lines (i.e. "foo:").
